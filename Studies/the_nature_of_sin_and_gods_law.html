    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 1: The Origin of Rebellion</h2>
      
      <p>Christ, the eternal Son of God, stood with the Father before any angels were created. His rule was always good and helpful, and no one ever questioned it. Then, a new feeling of anger and pride grew in Lucifer. At first, he did not fully understand these feelings. They were new to him; strange, mysterious, and hard to explain.</p>

      <div class="key-verse">
        "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 39: "Lucifer himself did not at first understand the true nature of his feelings. For a time, he was afraid to show what he was thinking and feeling, but he did not ignore the thoughts and feelings, he did not dismiss or discard the emotions and thoughts therefore He did not see that he was drifting away from God. But only the efforts of infinite love and wisdom could try to convince him he was wrong, so God showed Lucifer that His unhappiness and dissafection was proven to have no real cause or reason, and he was made to see what would happen if he kept rebelling."
      </div>

      <p>Lucifer was convinced he was wrong. He saw that "the Lord is right in all His ways, and holy in all His works". He had been convinced that God's laws are fair, and he should accept them before all heaven. If he had done this, he might have saved himself and many angels. At that time, he had not fully turned away from God. Though he had left his position as covering cherub, yet if he had been willing to return to God, acknowledging the Creator's wisdom, and satisfied to fill the place appointed him in God's great plan, he would have been reinstated in his office.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 2: The Final Choice</h2>
      
      <p>So now The time had come for a final choice; Lucifer had to fully accept God's sovereignty or place himself in open rebellion. He almost decided to return, but pride stopped him. It was too hard for someone who had been so honoured to admit he was wrong, that his thoughts were false, and to accept the authority he had been trying to prove unfair.</p>

      <p>But A loving Creator, feeling deep pity for Lucifer and his followers, was trying to bring them back from the terrible ruin they were about to fall into. But His kindness was misunderstood. Lucifer saw himself as powerful because of God's patience, thinking the King of the universe would agree to his demands. He told the angels that if they stood with him, they could gain all that they desired. He kept defending his choice and fully joined the great controversy against his Maker. This is how Lucifer, "the light bearer," who shared God's glory and stood by His throne, became Satan, "the enemy" of God and holy beings, and the destroyer of those Heaven had trusted to his care.</p>

      <p>At this pont, it was true to Satan himself that he had gone too far to come back. But not for those angels who were tricked by him. The advice and pleas of the loyal angels gave them hope; if they had listened, they might have escaped Satan's trap. But pride, love for their leader, and the wish for total freedom were stronger, and they finally refused God's love and mercy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 3: God's Patience and Purpose</h2>
      
      <p>God allowed Satan to continue his work until his anger grew into open rebellion. It was necessary for the plans of satan to fully develop so everyone could see their true nature and danger.</p>

      <p>Even after being thrown out of heaven, God's great wisdom did not destroy Satan. Because only love can please God, so His creatures must choose to serve Him because they believe He is just and kind. The beings in heaven and the worlds were not ready to understand sin or its results, so they could not see God's justice in destroying Satan then. If Satan had been wiped out immediately, some would have served God out of fear, They would not serve him out of love. So if God destroyed him, Satan's influence would not have been fully ended, nor would the spirit of rebellion be completely gone. For the good of the whole universe forever, Satan had to fully show his ideas so that all created beings could see the truth about God's government, and God's justice, His mercy, and unchanging law would be clear to everyone.</p>

      <p>Satan's rebellion was meant to teach the universe forever—a constant proof of the nature of sin and its terrible results. The way Satan ruled and its effects on both humans and angels would show what happens when God's authority is ignored. It would prove that the well-being of all God's creatures depends solely on God's government. So, the story of this terrible rebellion would always protect all holy beings, helping them not to be fooled about sin, to avoid sinning, and to avoid its punishment.</p>

      <p>The one who rules in heaven sees the end from the beginning—the one who knows all the mysteries of the past and future. Beyond the sadness, darkness, and ruin caused by sin, He sees the success of His plans of love and blessing. Though (Psalm 97:2) "clouds and darkness are around Him, righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne". One day, all beings in the universe, both loyal and disloyal, will understand this. (Deuteronomy 32:4) "His work is perfect: all His ways are fair. He is a God of truth, without wrong, just and right" .(Psalm 145:17) the Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 4: God's Law as the Foundation of Freedom</h2>
      
      <p>The Ten Commandments are the only true path to real freedom and lasting peace. They show us how to live in harmony with God's loving law. Without following these commandments, true peace cannot be found because they are the foundation of God's government.</p>

      <p>We cannot do anything on our own to save ourselves or live right; we must fully rely on God's strength and guidance. As the Bible says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:13). This reminds us that our power comes from God alone, and without Him, we can do nothing.</p>

      <p>No amount of success or money in the bank can save a person or bring lasting happiness.</p>

      <p>No amount of knowledge or education can make us right with God.</p>

      <p>No amount of power or influence can protect us from the consequences of sin.</p>

      <p>No amount of good works can earn us favor if we ignore God's law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 5: Recognizing Our Own Struggles with Sin</h2>
      
      <p>At first, Lucifer did not understand his feelings. Sometimes, we also do not fully understand our own sins and struggles. The Bible says, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8). Ellen G. White wrote, "Sin is a mystery to the angels and to the inhabitants of other worlds. It is a mystery to us also, and we cannot fully understand it here" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 39).</p>

      <p>This shows that sin is not always clear to us at first. We may feel confused or unsure about why we do wrong or why certain feelings arise within us. Just as Lucifer struggled to understand his pride and anger, we too can struggle to see the full danger of our sins. But God's commandments help us recognize what is right and wrong, guiding us away from the harm sin causes.</p>

      <p>Without God's law, we are lost and vulnerable. It is only by trusting in His guidance and strength that we can overcome our weaknesses and find true peace. We must not ignore or take lightly the commandments that show us the way to live in harmony with God and others. Understanding our sins is the first step toward turning back to God and receiving His forgiveness and help.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="study-section">
      <h2>Part 6: The Foundation of God's Government</h2>
      
      <div class="key-verse">
        "Patriarchs and Prophets" p. 307: "The law of God is the foundation of all government in heaven and earth. It is the transcript of the character of God, the foundation of His throne. It is immutable, unchangeable, and eternal. To disregard or oppose it is to rebel against God, and to bring ruin upon oneself."
      </div>

      <p>Let us remember that true freedom is found only in obeying God's law and trusting fully in His power and love.</p>

The Bible says, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8). Ellen G. White wrote, "Sin is a mystery to the angels and to the inhabitants of other worlds. It is a mystery to us also, and we cannot fully understand it here" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 39).</p>

      <p>This shows that sin is not always clear to us at first. We may feel confused or unsure about why we do wrong or why certain feelings arise within us. Just as Lucifer struggled to understand his pride and anger, we too can struggle to see the full danger of our sins. But God's commandments help us recognize what is right and wrong, guiding us away from the harm sin causes.</p>

      <p>Without God's law, we are lost and vulnerable. It is only by trusting in His guidance and strength that we can overcome our weaknesses and find true peace. We must not ignore or take lightly the commandments that show us the way to live in harmony with God and others. Understanding our sins is the first step toward turning back to God and receiving His forgiveness and help.</p>

      <h2>Part 6: The Foundation of God's Government</h2>
      
      <div class="key-verse">
        "Patriarchs and Prophets" p. 307: "The law of God is the foundation of all government in heaven and earth. It is the transcript of the character of God, the foundation of His throne. It is immutable, unchangeable, and eternal. To disregard or oppose it is to rebel against God, and to bring ruin upon oneself."

      <p>Let us remember that true freedom is found only in obeying God's law and trusting fully in His power and love.</p>
