    <p>
      Many people wonder if the Bible is a reliable record of history or simply a collection of myths and legends. In this study, we will examine evidence from archaeology, manuscript history, fulfilled prophecy, and the Bible‚Äôs impact on lives to help answer the question: Is the Bible facts or fiction?

          The Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele, is an inscribed stone set up around 840 BC by King Mesha of Moab. It describes Mesha‚Äôs victories over Israel and mentions King Omri, confirming the biblical account in 2 Kings 3. This artifact is one of the earliest references to the kingdom of Israel outside the Bible.<br><br>

          The Cyrus Cylinder, discovered in Babylon, contains a decree by Cyrus the Great after his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC. It describes his policy of allowing captive peoples to return to their lands and restore their temples. This aligns with the biblical account of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (Ezra 1:1-4).<br><br>
