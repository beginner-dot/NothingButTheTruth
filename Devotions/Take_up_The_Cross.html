    <h2><i class="fas fa-cross" style="color:#d9534f;"></i>Rise, Take Up Your Cross</h2>
    <h3><i class="fas fa-bible"></i>The Call of Christ</h3>
    <div class="quote">
      "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me."  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Luke 9:23 (KJV)</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Jesus’ invitation is radical and unrelenting. To "take up your cross" means more than just outward sacrifice—it’s a daily, all-encompassing surrender of self-will, pride, and sin. Ellen White explains that this is the path to true discipleship and victory.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Self-Denial as the Foundation:</strong> To follow Christ means to put aside selfish desires, embracing humility and obedience. 
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross1')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross1">
          Ellen White writes in <em>Steps to Christ</em>:  
          "To take up the cross means to submit to the correction of the Lord, to bear reproach, to endure hardship, to surrender self-will, and to endure the trials that come because of loyalty to Christ." (p. 70)  
          This is not a one-time event but a daily battle of the will.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Daily Commitment and Spiritual Growth:</strong> The cross is not a burden to be carried once and set down; it is a daily reality, shaping our character and molding us into Christ’s likeness. 
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross2')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross2">
          In <em>Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing</em>, Ellen White says:  
          "The cross of Christ reveals a love so great and a humility so deep that it changes hearts and transforms lives. To bear the cross is to walk in the footsteps of Jesus daily, sharing His love and sacrifice with others." (p. 46)  
          This ongoing process leads to victory over sin and deep peace.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Victory Through Sacrifice:</strong> Though the cross represents sacrifice, it also brings the greatest victory — freedom from sin and a close, personal relationship with God.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross3')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross3">
          The Bible teaches:  
          <div class="bible-verse"><b>Galatians 2:20</b> — "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</div>
          Ellen White affirms, "In self-denial and sacrifice we find true life." (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 69)  
          The cross is the gateway to spiritual triumph and eternal joy.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-heart" style="color:#d9534f;"></i>The Cross and Character Transformation</h3>
    <div class="quote">
      “Christ’s sacrifice is the power that renews the heart and changes the life.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Ellen G. White, <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 360</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      The cross is not only about death to self but about the birth of a new nature. The Spirit of Prophecy reveals how the cross renews character and empowers believers to live holy lives.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Crucifixion of the Old Nature:</strong> To take up the cross means to surrender the old selfish nature to Christ’s transforming power.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross4')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross4">
          Ellen White writes:  
          "The only condition upon which we can obey God perfectly is by surrendering ourselves to Him wholly, letting Him take full control." (<em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 311)  
          This is a daily dying to self and a rising to newness of life.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Developing Christlike Qualities:</strong> The cross fosters love, patience, humility, and steadfastness in believers.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross5')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross5">
          The Spirit of Prophecy emphasizes:  
          "The cross reveals God’s love and calls us to reflect that love in our daily lives by bearing the fruit of the Spirit." (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 71)  
          Through trials and sacrifice, we grow in grace.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Endurance in Trials:</strong> Bearing the cross means persevering in faith despite opposition, suffering, and temptation.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross6')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross6">
          Ellen White counsels:  
          "The cross means self-denial and suffering, but also victory and joy for those who endure." (<em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 362)  
          The Christian life is a victorious pilgrimage.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" style="color:#2575fc;"></i>Practical Application</h3>
    <p>
      The call to take up your cross is not theoretical; it is deeply practical and affects every aspect of daily living.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Daily Prayer and Surrender:</strong> Begin each day by yielding your will to God, asking Him to guide your thoughts, words, and actions.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross7')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross7">
          Ellen White encourages believers:  
          "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. It is the daily communion by which the believer is strengthened to bear the cross." (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 93)  
          Through prayer, we gain power for the struggle ahead.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving Others in Love:</strong> Taking up the cross includes humble service and sacrificial love for those around us.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross8')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross8">
          The Bible says:  
          <div class="bible-verse"><b>Mark 10:45</b> — "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve..."</div>
          Ellen White adds, "True religion manifests itself in acts of kindness, charity, and love." (<em>The Ministry of Healing</em>, p. 35)  
          Service is the tangible expression of bearing the cross.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rejecting Worldly Values:</strong> To follow Christ’s cross means rejecting selfish ambition, materialism, and sinful pleasures.  
        <span class="readmore-link" onclick="toggleReadMore('rm-cross9')">Read more</span>
        <div class="readmore-box" id="rm-cross9">
          Ellen White warns,  
          "The world is a battlefield where the cross of Christ is often despised, but we must remain faithful and separate from its temptations." (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 69)  
          Our values must align with God’s kingdom.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-flag-checkered" style="color:#2575fc;"></i>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The call to rise and take up your cross is the heart of true Christianity. It is a call to die daily to self and live fully for Christ. It is demanding, but it brings transformation, victory, and eternal joy.
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      “The cross of Christ is the foundation of all our hopes and the source of all our power to live the Christian life.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Ellen G. White, <em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 70</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      Are you ready to answer the call? To surrender fully, embrace sacrifice, and walk in the footsteps of Jesus every day?  
      The promise is sure: “Those who lose their life for My sake will find it.” (Matthew 10:39)
