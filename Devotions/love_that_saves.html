      <h1>Love That Saves</h1>
      <span class="header-subtitle">A Devotion on the Transforming Power of Divine Love</span>
    </div>

    <h2>❤️ The Heart of Redemption</h2>
    <p>The story of salvation is a love letter written in blood—Jesus’ blood—poured out to redeem humanity. From Genesis to Revelation, God’s love is not passive; it is purposeful, sacrificial, and powerful.</p>
    <div class="bible-verse">
      “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” — John 3:16
    </div>

    <h2>📖 The Spirit of Prophecy</h2>
    <p>Ellen White beautifully captured this theme in her book <em>Steps to Christ</em>:</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “The Son of God came from heaven to make manifest the Father... Every act of Christ's life was a revelation of God.” 
      <span class="quote-cite">— Steps to Christ, p. 11</span>
    </div>
    <p>This love that saves isn't abstract—it’s embodied in every healing touch, every word of forgiveness, and ultimately, on the cross where mercy triumphed over judgment.</p>

    <div class="glass-box">
      <h3>🔍 Reflective Thought</h3>
      <p>Divine love is not earned—it is received. Jesus didn’t wait for us to be perfect. He came while we were broken, proving that love that saves is love that stoops.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        “But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” — Romans 5:8
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>🌍 Love That Embraces the World</h2>
    <p>God’s love doesn’t discriminate—it embraces all. Jesus mingled with the poor, the outcast, the sinner, making it clear that no one is beyond the reach of grace.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— The Ministry of Healing, p. 143</span>
    </div>

    <h2>🕊️ Love That Forgives</h2>
    <p>Forgiveness is one of the most powerful expressions of love. Jesus’ final words on the cross—“Father, forgive them…”—echo through eternity, reminding us that divine love is not reactive but redemptive.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “In the courts above, Christ is pleading for His church... Yet He does not forget His suffering children here.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 156</span>
    </div>

    <h2>🔥 Love That Transforms</h2>
    <p>God's love does not leave us the same—it empowers change.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “The love of Christ constrains us; it awakens in the soul the desire to know more of truth...”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 227</span>
    </div>

    <h2>🛡️ Love That Conquers</h2>
    <p>Romans 8 declares that nothing—no hardship, no sin, no enemy—can separate us from the love of God in Christ.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “It is Satan’s constant work to misrepresent the character of God... but Christ came to reveal the Father.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— The Desire of Ages, p. 19</span>
    </div>

    <div class="glass-box">
      <h3>🙌 How Should We Respond?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Receive His love:</strong> Let the truth of the cross transform how you see yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflect His love:</strong> Be a living testimony of grace in action.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest in His love:</strong> Let go of fear and guilt—His love has secured your future.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
      “Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves... By His stripes we are healed.”
      <span class="quote-cite">— The Desire of Ages, p. 25</span>
    </div>

    <h2>✨ Devotional Challenge</h2>
    <p>Spend the next 7 days reflecting on how you’ve experienced the saving love of God. Journal answers to these prompts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When have I felt loved by God despite my failures?</li>
      <li>How can I show sacrificial love to someone this week?</li>
      <li>What fear or guilt is holding me back from fully receiving God’s love?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Final Prayer</h2>
    <p>Lord, help us to comprehend the height and depth of Your love—a love that reaches down to lift us up. Let us walk in the freedom You purchased and share that love with a world aching to be healed.</p>
