      <h1>Hannah's Devotion</h1>
      <span class="header-subtitle">A Prayer of Faith and Sacrifice</span>
    </div>

    <h2>👩‍🍼 Her Story of Devotion</h2>
    <p>Hannah was a woman tormented by barrenness. Yet her sorrow turned into spiritual strength when she went to the temple and poured out her heart to God. Her prayer was so intense that Eli, the priest, thought she was drunk.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “O Lord Almighty, if You will only look upon Your servant’s misery and remember me... then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life.”
      <span class="quote-cite">— 1 Samuel 1:11</span>
    </div>

    <p>God heard Hannah's desperate plea and blessed her with a son, Samuel. True to her vow, Hannah brought Samuel to the temple and dedicated him to God’s service. Her story reflects the beauty and weight of a devotion that is both tender and courageous.</p>

    <h2>🌱 Devotional Reflection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Devotion through prayer:</strong> Hannah’s words weren’t rehearsed—they were raw and real.</li>
      <li><strong>Faith under pressure:</strong> She believed even when her hope seemed faint.</li>
      <li><strong>Sacrifice in trust:</strong> Giving Samuel to God wasn’t just symbolic—it was deeply personal.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bible-verse">
      “She said to him, ‘As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord.’” — 1 Samuel 1:26
    </div>

    <h2>💡 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Devotion isn't just about ritual—it's about surrender. Like Hannah, we are invited to lay down our desires, trust God with the outcomes, and follow through in faith.</p>
