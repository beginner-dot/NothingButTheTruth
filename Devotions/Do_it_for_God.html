      <h1>Faithful in All Things</h1>
      <span class="header-subtitle">Honoring God Through Every Act, Large or Small</span>
    </div>

    <h2>🌿 A Divine Calling in Everyday Life</h2>
    <p>Service to God is not reserved solely for grand gestures or public ministries. Scripture reminds us that faithfulness in small things is profoundly significant to the Lord. Each word spoken in kindness, each task completed with integrity, each silent prayer lifted in faith—all are fragrant offerings before Him.</p>

    <h2>👣 Biblical Examples of Humble Service</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>David:</strong> Before becoming king, he served faithfully as a shepherd and musician.</li>
      <li><strong>Tabitha (Dorcas):</strong> Remembered in Acts for her charitable sewing and care for widows.</li>
      <li><strong>The boy with loaves and fish:</strong> Though nameless, his small gift fed thousands through Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⚙️ Your Work Is Your Witness</h2>
    <p>Whether employed in business, education, agriculture, homemaking, or ministry, every believer has a sacred opportunity to reflect Christ through diligence, excellence, and humility. No act done in love and obedience is ever insignificant.</p>
    <div class="bible-verse">
      “He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much.” — Luke 16:10
    </div>

    <h2>📜 Tomorrow’s Challenge</h2>
    <p>As you enter tomorrow, make it a point to honor God with one intentional act of service. Let it be something that seems small, yet is done with great love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a note of encouragement to someone discouraged.</li>
      <li>Pray for a neighbor who may be struggling silently.</li>
      <li>Be exceptionally kind in a routine interaction.</li>
      <li>Offer help where none is expected.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="quote">
      “There is nothing too small for God to notice, nor too big for Him to handle. Faithfulness in little things prepares us for larger responsibilities.”

    <h2>🌟 Encouragement for the Journey</h2>
    <p>You need not wait for the spotlight to serve. You are already commissioned to carry light into daily places: your home, your workplace, your community, your circle of friends. Let every task—be it hidden or seen—be done unto Him.</p>

      Need further inspiration? Read the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14–30. Consider how each servant was rewarded not for the size of their gift—but for their faithfulness.
