    <h1>💖 Devotion of the Day: *The Anchor of Hope*</h1>
    <span class="header-subtitle">Hebrews 6:19 – "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure."</span>
  </div>

  <h2>Anchored in Storms</h2>
  <p>
    Life can feel like a turbulent sea — one moment calm, the next raging with waves of doubt, fear, or pain. But the Bible gives us a promise that steadies the soul: *Hope in Christ*. Hebrews 6:19 tells us that this hope is like an anchor — <em>firm, secure, unshakable</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="bible-verse">
    "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure." – Hebrews 6:19
  </div>

  <p>
    In ancient times, ships would drop anchors to remain stable during storms. Similarly, we drop the anchor of God’s promises into the ocean of life. While emotions may toss us, God’s Word holds us.

    “God is not a man, that He should lie.” – Numbers 23:19  
    <span class="quote-cite">You can trust Him, even when it’s dark.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Why Hope in Christ?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Because His promises are unbreakable</li>
    <li>Because His resurrection secures our future</li>
    <li>Because even in silence, He is still sovereign</li>
  </ul>

    <strong>💡 Encouragement:</strong>
    <p>Maybe your heart is weary today. Maybe you’ve cried silently. But God sees. And He holds every tear in His hand (Psalm 56:8).</p>

    <div class="bible-verse">
      "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." – Psalm 23:4
    </div>

    <p>Let His truth be louder than your fear. He is not finished with you yet.</p>
