      <h1>Called to Shine</h1>
      <span class="header-subtitle">Living as Lights in a World That Needs Hope</span>
    </div>

    <h2>💡 You Are the Light</h2>
    <p>Jesus declared, “You are the light of the world.” That isn’t a suggestion—it’s a declaration of identity. Wherever darkness exists, light makes the difference.</p>
    <div class="bible-verse">
      “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.” — Matthew 5:14–16
    </div>

    <h2>🌱 The Purpose of Light</h2>
    <p>Light doesn’t exist for itself—it reveals, warms, guides, and grows. As believers, we are called to embody this mission: reflecting Christ’s character in practical ways.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “God expects personal service from everyone to whom He has entrusted a knowledge of the truth. The light that shines from them is to guide others.”  
      <span class="quote-cite">— Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 418</span>
    </div>

    <h2>📖 Biblical Examples of Radiant Faith</h2>

      <li><strong>Daniel:</strong> Shone in Babylon by standing firm in prayer and integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Esther:</strong> Became a light in the palace, risking her life for her people.</li>
      <li><strong>Paul:</strong> Lit up the Gentile world by preaching the resurrected Christ despite persecution.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bible-verse">
      “Among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life.” — Philippians 2:15–16
    </div>

    <h2>🕯️ Light in Action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speak with grace:</strong> Words can either illuminate or dim someone’s spirit.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve with love:</strong> Small acts of kindness ripple into eternity.</li>
      <li><strong>Stand with courage:</strong> Truth shines brightest when the world dims.</li>
      <li><strong>Share with boldness:</strong> Don’t underestimate the power of your testimony.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>🔍 Reflective Thought</h3>
      <p>You were not designed to blend in—you were made to stand out, to shine, to point toward the Source of light. In this divine calling, we find not pressure—but purpose.</p>
      <div class="bible-verse">
        “For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.” — Ephesians 5:8
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>🌄 A Life That Glorifies</h2>
    <p>We don’t shine so others admire us—we shine so they see Him. A surrendered life becomes a lighthouse leading others home.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “Those who have put on Christ... will not act from impulse, but from principle.”

    <div class="readmore-box">
      <strong>Devotion Challenge:</strong> For the next 5 days, light a candle during prayer time as a physical reminder of your calling. Ask God to show you where to shine—at home, in work, in worship.
      <div class="bible-verse">
        “Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” — Matthew 13:43
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>🙏 Closing Prayer</h2>
    <p>Lord, You have called us to be light-bearers. Remind us today that we reflect You—not by striving, but by surrendering. Illuminate our hearts and make us radiant in every moment. Amen.</p>
